    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza dough that rises for 24 hours in the fridge. How does it taste? Sensational. It is extremely fluffy and crispy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wheat flour - 450g</li>
        <li>Warm water - 300ml</li>
        <li>Fresh yeast - 4g</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Oil - 3 tbsp</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 level teaspoon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pizza dough at least 24 hours before baking. First make the leaven - mix yeast, sugar, 1 tablespoon of flour and 5 tablespoons of water.
            Leave it to stand for about 10 minutes until it becomes very foamy. Combine the leaven with the remaining ingredients and knead into a dough.
            If it sticks to your hands, add a little more flour. Put the dough into a container and place in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Remove 2 hours before 
            baking and leave at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Over 24 hours in the fridge, the dough will definitely increase in volume. After rising, divide the dough in half. On a semolina-floured board, 
            form a cake with a slightly higher edge. Spread the centre with tomato sauce, sprinkle with herbs and arrange your favourite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza on a stone or in a pizza tin, on the highest oven temperature. It took 8 minutes to bake in mine because the dough was quite thick.
            With a thin pizza, the time will certainly be reduced.</li>
